# voila

Command line software and jupyterlab extension to turn a notebook into a web page linked to python kernel, allowing python-callback interactions (instead of just static HTML-exported notebook).
It differs from nbconvert in that the output web application is connected to a Jupyter kernel, allowing it to respond to user input through widget controls and other UI components, while with nbconvert, any action that requires a roundtrip to the kernel will not work.


## CLI usage
This will open a web page with the result interactive dashboard:
`voila my_notebook_with_widgets.ipynb`

By default, VoilÃ  runs at localhost:8866. Running `voila`in a directory will open a file browser that can render notebooks.

Common args : 
 - `--strip_sources=False` : By default, the code cells are stripped. To keep the code-cells, strip_sources is set to False
 - `--theme=dark`: change theme

## voila jupyterlab extension
`jupyter labextension install @jupyter-voila/jupyterlab-preview`

2 possibilities : 
 - display the rendered voila in a side-pane : View -> Render Notebook with Voila
 - display the rendered voila in a new browser tab : View -> Open Voila in new Browser tab

Also, in notebook toolbar, click on Voila icon to render in new side-pane
