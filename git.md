## git blame
```
git blame <filename> : list commits concerning a file
```

## git branch
```
git branch : list all branches with * on current branch
git branch -r : list remote tracked branches
git branch branch_name : create branch called branch_name
git branch –d branch_name : delete branch with check for unmerged commits
git branch –D branch_name : delete branch
git branch branch_name tag_name : create branch from tagged commit
```

Other commands about branches : 
```
git checkout branch_name : Change branch
git merge branch_to_merge : go to 'main' branch, then this merges branch_to_merge on current branch 
git push origin origin:refs/heads/new_name_branch : create branch on server (then track that branch!)
git push origin :heads/branch_name : delete branch of server
```

About branches : 
There are 2 types of branches :
 - local branches, stored in .git/refs/heads
 - remote-tracked branches, stored in .git/refs/remotes

Pulls/pushes only concern current branch, not all tracked branches.

## git config 
```
git config --list : list configs
```

## git checkout
```
git checkout SHA : set on commit numbered SHA
git checkout –b branch_name : create new branch from HEAD, and set on new branch

git commit –a –m "update file" : create commit on indexed files only
git commit –a : commit already indexed files (ie updates allready tracked files but doesn't add files to index)
git commit --amend : open editor to change commit message
git commit --amend –m "new message" : change last commit's message
git commit -m "Title" -m "Description..." : commit with message and description
```

# Concepts
## git ignore
The hidden file '.gitignore' contains the file list to be ignored by git. This file can be tracked by the repo just like any other file.  
Use '\*.tmp' to ignore all files ending in '.tmp'.  
Use 'tmp/*' to ignore all content of dir 'tmp/'.  

## git config
The git config file is located in the home dir. It is a hidden file (CMD+fn+MAJ+; to display hiddenf file on Azerty/MAC OS).
It could look like this : 
```
[user]
	name = John Doe
	email = john@doe.com
[color]
	diff = auto
	status = auto
	branch = auto
	ui = true
[core]
	excludesfile = /Users/JohnDoe/.gitignore_global
[alias]
		ci = commit
		co = checkout
		st = status
		br = branch
```

To manipulate configs:
```
git help config : open config help
git config --list : list all config
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --decorate --all --graph". You can then use git lg

git config --global user.name "mocquin" : to setup name
git config --global user.email mocquin@me.com : to setup mail

git config --global color.diff auto
git config --global color.status auto
git config --global color.branch auto 
git config --global color.ui true

alias gg='git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color'
git config --global alias.graph "log --graph --oneline –decorate=short"
```

## origin
origin is the default name from which a repo is cloned

## Merging, rebasing, pushing, pulling
Rebase is basically "unbuilding" the branch's commits, then applying them on master, and fast forward.
By default, a merge will try to fastforward, and delete the historic of the 2 branches.

### rebase
Rebase allows you to rewrite the history with -I

### fast forward, true merge
Git merge --no-ff : merge without fast-forward, allowing "true merge": a fast-forward can be done when master has no new commit since the branch was created, so that the ref pointer to master could be moved to the head of the branch being merged. This allow to keep the historic separated, and create a merge commit for that branch.

If you don't want to keep a separated branch : 
 - If master has no new commit, a merge will do a fast-forward by default (and give the same result as a rebase).
 - If master has new commit, a merge will create a merge commit, which you don't want. Use rebase to make fast-froward possible.

Difference between rebase and merge :
 - A merge will create a merge commit.
 - A rebase will "rewrite" the history of the branch, by changing the divergence point of the branch to take into account the new commit since the creation of the branch. It change the base of the branch. Consist in dismounting the branch commit by commit, move the branch starting commit, and reapply commit on the top.

Note you should NEVER use rebase on a public branch.

A rebase is a good occasion to interactively refactor commit with git rebase -I.

If branch is a LOCAL, temporary branch : starting from an updated master, and moving through commit without pushing them : no reason to keep a distinct branch in tree : use a rebase if there are new commits, or merge with fast-forward otherwise.

If the branch is known/identified (about an issue, a sprint, etc) : you want to keep track of that branch in history, so you need a merge commit BUT if master has no new commit, git will try to fast-forward.

Git pull –-rebase : fait un fetch puis un rebase (contraintement à git pull qui fait un fetch puis un merge)

Merging safely :
 - Method 1 : Create a branch on master called "savepoint", but don't move to it. Merge the feature branch on master. If successful, delete savepoint branch. Else, do git reset --hard savepoint to go back to savepoint.
 - Method 2 : Create a branch on master called "scout", and move to it. Merge feature branch on scout. If successful, merge scout on master (which should simply be a fast-forward of master). Else, go back on master and delete scout.

### pulling
Always pull before pushing. 
A pull is basically a fetch followed by merge

In detached-HEAD mode, HEAD is no longuer pointing to a branch tip. At this point, commiting will create an anonymous branch, and leaving that branch for another will make this commit "orphan", and so you will not be able to come back to it - there is no reference (ref or parent commit). You have to create a branch for that commit


## git’s objects
Objects are stored in the .git/objects
git cat-file commit a6dbf05551541dc86b7a49212b62cfe1e9bb14f2 : display a user friendly text of the commit object
git ls-tree f89e64bdfcc08a8b371ee76a74775cfe096655ce : display a user friendly text of the tree object
git cat-file blob 5d92c127156d3d86b70ae41c73973434bf4bf341 : display a user friendly text of a file
 
A commit objects basically represents a commit : it has its own SHA, and points to a tree object.
A tree object has its own SHA, and points to files objects – which are called blob objects
When a file is modified and the changes are commited : git first creates a new blob object representing the new content of that file. Then creates a new tree object, with a pointer to the new file blob, and pointers to files that were not changed (it is reusing the same blob object). Then creates a commit object, with a pointer to its new tree object, AND a pointer to the last commit object – its parent commit. When a file is deleted and the change is commited : in the new commit object (that also points to its parent commit and its tree object), the tree object has no reference to a blob object for that file : it doesn’t know it, only the previous commits have references to a blob file for that file. When a folder is created and the change commited, the commit object points to a tree object – the main folder-, and that tree object points to : blob objects for files in that directory, and a tree object for each subfolder (each of them having reference to blob objects for files that they contain).
 
Blob objects :
-          Key : SHA-1, used as object’s name
-          Value : content, content of the file
Commit object :
-          Last commit object (parent)
-          Pointer to the tree object
-          Commiter name
-          Commit message
 
For each object, the SHA-1 used the first 2 character as directory name, and 38 characters left as object’s filename
 

git cat-file -t 70c379b63ffa0795fdbfbc128e5a2818397b7ef8 : return git object type
git cat-file -p f29f2741b30ecc1529da7dbae4aff9974b69e271 : return git object content
git hash-object toto : return git has for toto file. This is only an image of the file content, not its name.
When adding a file to the index, a blob object is created. It is not deleted if the file is deleted/reseted.

    
    
## HEAD and references (branches)
References are stored in the .git/refs/heads
cat .git/refs/heads/master : display a user friendly text of the reference
cat .git/HEAD : display a user friendly text of the current HEAD pointer
 
A branch is tracked by git by tracking the last commit SHA of that branch. Since every commit object has a pointer to its parent commit object, a branch is entirely defined by its last commit. That is because a commit ALWAYS has ONE parent commit.
A reference is basically a branch, or branch name, that contains the SHA of the last commit of that branch
Creating a new branch will simply create a new file in .git/refs/heads, containing the commit SHA of that branch.
 
## index
Index is truly a file that keeps track of the file changes of the 3 areas : working tree, staging area, and repository.
 
When switching branch from master to feature with a checkout, git first moves the HEAD to the feature ref. That ref is a pointer to the last commit of that branch, which is a commit object, pointing to a tree object and blobs objects (files in a given state). Then, git updates the content of the .git/index file, with for each file, a last update date, and a SHA for the wdir, a SHA for the staging area, and a SHA for the repo. Finally, git will change the wdir content to match that of the commit HEAD is pointing to. Hence, after a checkout, all files has the same content : in the wdir, in the index where the 3 areas have the same checksums for all files, and the repo.
When a file is changed, git first keeps track of that change in the index, where it creates a new checksum for that file for the wdir area, and compare that checksum to that of the staging area of the index for that file. A git status will so tell us that there are changes that are not staged. Using git add will add this change to the staging area in the index. Then git creates a new blob object to match this new file content. At this point, there is a new blob object in the repo, but it isn’t attributed to any tree/commit object. A git status will then tell us that there are changes that are about to be commited. A git commit will then : (1)create a new commit object and a new tree object, that points to the new file blob (and the other file blobs that were not changed). (2) Move the feature ref pointer to the new commit (3) update the repo in the index (then all the area of the index are the same again).
